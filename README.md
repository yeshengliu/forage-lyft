# Lyft Back-End Engineering Program
This repo includes my work in Forage Virtual Experience Program sponsored by ***Lyft***

Throughout the program, I gained practical experience on designing a clean back-end code structure and refactored current codebase to enhance the project scalability

***[Description to the project](https://www.theforage.com/virtual-internships/prototype/xSw9echtixLAoPdsH/Lyft-Back-End-Engineering-Virtual-Experience-Program)***

## Overview
Step 1 - Case study and generate UML diagram

Step 2 - Refactor codebase according to the updated UML

Step 3 - Write unit tests for a newly refactored system

Step 4 - Add new functionality using TDD (Test-Driven Development)

## Challenge

1. Familiarize with OOD implementations in Python
2. Come up with a sustainable clean design given the case description
3. Utilize Python unit test package to generate test cases
